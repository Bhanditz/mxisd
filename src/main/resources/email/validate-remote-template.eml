Hello there!

We have received a request to link this email address with your Matrix account.

Due to the security policy in place, this email address can only be stored in the central Matrix Identity Server.
If you continue, your e-mail address and Matrix ID association will be made public without any current mean to be removed.

If you would still like to continue, you will need to:
1. Go to your private Public registration process page:

  %VALIDATION_LINK%

2. Follow the registration process of the central Identity Server, usually another email with similar content
3. Once your email address validated with the central Identity Server, click on "Continue" on page of step #1
4. If your public association is found by our Identity server, the next step will be given to you.


If you didn't make this request, or do not want to make your address public, you can safely disregard this email.
